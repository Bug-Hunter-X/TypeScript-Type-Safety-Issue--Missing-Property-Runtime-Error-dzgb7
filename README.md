# TypeScript Type Safety Bug

This repository demonstrates a common type safety issue in TypeScript where the compiler's type checking doesn't fully protect against runtime errors caused by missing properties in objects.  The `bug.ts` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.ts` presents a solution using optional properties and type guards.
